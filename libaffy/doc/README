Building the Documentation
==========================

If you received a 'release' version of libaffy, there should be prebuilt
DVI, PDF, Info, and HTML files already present in this directory.  You
can stop reading now if that is the case.

Otherwise, you may wish to rebuild the docs from the texinfo source.

When using the SCons-based build system, documentation is built only
when the 'build_docs=1' option is supplied on the command line at build
time.

You will need the GNU Texinfo tools to build the Info or HTML versions
of the docs, or if you want to rebuild the DVI version.  If you want to
rebuild the PDF version, SCons will try to detect an appropriate toolchain 
to convert the DVI to a PDF file.  Most likely this means Ghostscript or 
some kind of TeX distribution.
